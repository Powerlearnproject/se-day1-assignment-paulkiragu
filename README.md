# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

(a).Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

-It is systematic use of engineering principles, methods and tools in design, development, testing, Deployment and maintenance
of software systems.
.Building Systems-software engineering is used to solve problems like breaching the gap between two parties that need to communicate and
are in different location by creating systems such as social media platforms eg whatsapp enhancing communication via a network.
.Security-software  engineering enhances security in fields like banking system by creating secure systems and minimizing risks of failure
.Reliability-Software engineering enables creation of high quality softwares that work consistently and effectively
.Collaboration-it enhances teamwork through version control in the entire software development life cycle keeping the software functioning correctly through maintenance
.Scalability-It enables to create softwares that can grow in size, number of users without breaking down.

                         

(b).Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

.Introduction of Programming languages-before software engineering birth programmers wrote code using low level languages like machine language
but with introduction of software engineering high level languages imerged such as Fortran which made coding more easier and accesible
.Software development methodologies-Agile methodology is one of the key methodologies that emerged which enhanced flexibilty and faster development life cycle
due to its iteration capabilities.
.Creation of object oriented programming such as c++ which made code more usable which drastically affect the speed of software development


(c).List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

.Requirements gathering- this phase stakeholders are requested for what they want their software to do and understand the scope of the project
.Design-in this phase the architectural design of the system is done and the UI/UX is accomplished.
.Implementation- developers turn the design into functioning software using programming language 
.Testing-the built software is tested here in ways like integration testing to make sure it reaches the standards and functions correctly.
.Deployment-The created software is made availbale to the users by making it live
.Maintenance-once the software is made accesible to the end user updates and bugs are fixed occassionally 

(d).Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
.Waterfall methodology is linear that is one stage has to be completend before the  other one while agile it is iterative where a stage can be revisited
.Waterfall final product is delivered at the end of the process while agile product delivered regularly
.Waterfall testing happens after the development is complete while agile testing  is done as development is ongoing
-scenario where waterfall is used is a hospital management system where the goal is well defined 
-scenario for agile is social media app where user feedback is used to update the system

(e).Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software Developer 
.Coding & Implementation: developers are resposible in writing functioning code to   
.System Design: Help design the software architecture and structure.  
.Bug Fixing: developers Debug and resolve issues during development and after testing.  

.Documentation: they Create technical documentation for future reference and onboarding.  

Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer 
.Test Planning: they Design test cases and define testing strategies.  
.Manual & Automated Testing: Perform tests to catch bugs and verify that features work as expected.  
.Bug Reporting: Log issues, track their status, and verify fixes.  
.Regression Testing: Re-test the software after changes to ensure new updates don’t break existing functionality.   
Project Manager  
.Planning & Scheduling:they make project timelines, milestones, and deliverables. 
.Team Coordination: Facilitate communication between development team and stakeholders,  
.Requirement Management:they Gather, document, and clarify requirements.  
.Progress Monitoring: they keep Track of the team’s progress, identify blockers, and adjust plans as needed.  

(f).Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

IDES
.Code editor-helps write code with autocomplete feature
.Debugging-helps in debugging code
.Extensions and plugins-it helps i integaration of extensions such as live server
example is visual studio

Version control
.Collaboration-it helps team to work together in the same project even remotely
.Change tracking-it keeps a record of every change that is made to the code
.Backup and recovery-it stores data of user in a net thus cant be lost
example Git

(g).What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
.Keep up with evolving technology developers use strategies like dedicating regular time for learning another strategy is follow up on linkedin and X
.Managing complex system strategy used is break down large project to smaller managable components, Document code and update README files
.Debugging-since this is the biggest challenge developers use some debugging tools such as chrome Devtools, add error handling catch and messages
.Collaboration-miscommunication might happen between developers thus tools like slack are used to keep things organized, hold regular meetings


(h).Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing
-It is verifying that pieces of code work correctly independently 
.it helps catch bugs early
.Helps in making maintanable code

Integration testing
-verifying how different modules work together 
.helps in API requests and database interactions
.Prevent integration failure

System testing
-it is testing the entire system as whole
.validates overall functionality of the system
.Ensures system meets technical specificaations

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


(a).Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
.Prompt engineering is all about crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models. 

(b).Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt
.describe cats 
Corrected prompt
give me the history of domestic cats- this prompt is effective since it is clear it want information about cats it is concise that it wants speciffically domestic cats and it is correct prompt
