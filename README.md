# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

-It is systematic use of engineering principles, methods and tools in design, development, testing, Deployment and maintenance
of software systems.
.Building Systems-software engineering is used to solve problems like breaching the gap between two parties that need to communicate and
are in different location by creating systems such as social media platforms eg whatsapp enhancing communication via a network.
.Security-software  engineering enhances security in fields like banking system by creating secure systems and minimizing risks of failure
.Reliability-Software engineering enables creation of high quality softwares that work consistently and effectively
.Collaboration-it enhances teamwork through version control in the entire software development life cycle keeping the software functioning correctly through maintenance
.Scalability-It enables to create softwares that can grow in size, number of users without breaking down.

                         

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

.Introduction of Programming languages-before software engineering birth programmers wrote code using low level languages like machine language
but with introduction of software engineering high level languages imerged such as Fortran which made coding more easier and accesible
.Software development methodologies-Agile methodology is one of the key methodologies that emerged which enhanced flexibilty and faster development life cycle
due to its iteration capabilities.
.Creation of object oriented programming such as c++ which made code more usable which drastically affect the speed of software development


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

.Requirements gathering- this phase stakeholders are requested for what they want their software to do and understand the scope of the project
.Design-in this phase the architectural design of the system is done and the UI/UX is accomplished.
.Implementation- developers turn the design into functioning software using programming language 
.Testing-the built software is tested here in ways like integration testing to make sure it reaches the standards and functions correctly.
.Deployment-The created software is made availbale to the users by making it live
.Maintenance-once the software is made accesible to the end user updates and bugs are fixed occassionally 

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodology is linear that is one stage has to be com

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
